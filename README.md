# Transformer-Based-Model

Simplified example of how a neural network model for natural language processing (NLP), like GPT, might be structured using libraries like PyTorch.

Here’s an extremely simplified version of a transformer-based model, which is a core part of models like GPT:
'''
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# A simplified transformer model for educational purposes
class SimpleTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embed_size, num_heads, num_layers):
        super(SimpleTransformer, self).__init__()
        
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embed_size)
        self.transformer = nn.Transformer(d_model=embed_size, nhead=num_heads, num_encoder_layers=num_layers)
        self.fc_out = nn.Linear(embed_size, vocab_size)
    
    def forward(self, src):
        # Input src: batch_size x sequence_length
        embedded = self.embedding(src)  # shape: batch_size x sequence_length x embed_size
        embedded = embedded.permute(1, 0, 2)  # Permute for transformer: sequence_length x batch_size x embed_size
        output = self.transformer(embedded, embedded)  # self-attention: source, source
        output = output.permute(1, 0, 2)  # Permute back
        return self.fc_out(output)  # shape: batch_size x sequence_length x vocab_size

# Example usage
vocab_size = 10000  # Example vocabulary size
embed_size = 512  # Embedding dimension
num_heads = 8  # Attention heads
num_layers = 6  # Transformer layers

# Initialize model
model = SimpleTransformer(vocab_size, embed_size, num_heads, num_layers)

# Dummy input: batch_size = 2, sequence_length = 10 (word indices)
src = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (2, 10))

# Forward pass
output = model(src)

print(output.shape)  # Expected output: (2, 10, vocab_size)
'''
This example showcases the architecture of a very simplified transformer model that could be used for NLP tasks. It includes:
	•	Embedding: Converts input tokens (word indices) into continuous vectors.
	•	Transformer: The core part of the model using self-attention to process the input.
	•	Fully connected layer: To map the output to the vocabulary size.

For a real GPT-style model, it would involve much more complexity in terms of fine-tuning, optimizations, large datasets, and infrastructure. But this should give you a rough idea of how transformer models are structured.

1. The Transformer Architecture

The core innovation behind models like GPT is the transformer architecture, which was introduced in the paper “Attention is All You Need” by Vaswani et al. (2017). The transformer relies heavily on a mechanism called self-attention to process sequences of data (like text) in parallel, unlike previous models like RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), which process sequences sequentially.

Key Components of the Transformer:
	1.	Self-Attention Mechanism: This is the heart of the transformer. It allows each token (word or part of a word) to focus on (attend to) all other tokens in the sequence, making it possible to capture long-range dependencies. In simple terms, it allows the model to understand relationships between words in a sentence, regardless of their distance from each other.
	2.	Multi-Head Attention: Instead of having a single attention mechanism, transformers use multiple attention heads, which enables the model to attend to different aspects of the input simultaneously. Each head processes the sequence independently, and their results are combined.
	3.	Positional Encoding: Since transformers don’t process data sequentially, they need a way to encode the position of each token in the sequence. This is done using positional encodings, which are added to the input embeddings to give the model information about the position of each word.
	4.	Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN): After attention layers, the model passes the data through a fully connected neural network (the feed-forward network), which allows it to learn non-linear relationships and further refine its understanding of the sequence.
	5.	Layer Normalization and Residual Connections: These techniques help stabilize training and improve the model’s ability to learn. Each attention layer and feed-forward network is followed by a residual connection, meaning the output of the layer is added back to the original input, helping the gradient flow during training.
	6.	Stacked Layers: Transformers are usually composed of many layers of attention and feed-forward networks. GPT, for example, has up to 96 layers in the largest models. Each layer refines the output further.

2. Attention Mechanism in Detail

Let’s break down self-attention to understand how it works in more depth. The key idea is that each word (or token) in the input sequence pays attention to all other words to calculate its new representation.

For each word (token) in the input, we compute three vectors:
	•	Query (Q): The word’s representation that will “ask” the model for attention.
	•	Key (K): The representation of all the other words that will be “looked at” for relevance.
	•	Value (V): The actual content (information) that will be passed on when a word attends to others.

The process is as follows:
	1.	Score Calculation: First, we compute a score between each query and all keys using the dot product. This score determines how much attention one word should give to another. These scores are then scaled down (to prevent large values) by dividing by the square root of the dimension of the key.
￼
Where:
	•	￼ is the query matrix,
	•	￼ is the key matrix,
	•	￼ is the dimension of the keys (used for scaling).
	2.	Softmax: We apply a softmax function to the scores to turn them into probabilities, making sure they sum up to 1. This helps us figure out how much each token should attend to the others.
￼
	3.	Weighted Sum: After obtaining the attention weights, we calculate a weighted sum of the value vectors. This gives us the final representation of each word after it has attended to all other words in the sequence.
￼
	4.	Final Output: The output from each attention head is passed through a linear layer to project it back to the appropriate dimensionality.

3. GPT’s Architecture: A Decoder-Only Transformer

While the original transformer architecture was designed to have an encoder-decoder structure (like for translation tasks), GPT uses a decoder-only architecture. Let’s break it down:
	1.	Causal Masking: Since GPT is a language model (and thus generates text sequentially), it uses causal masking during training. This means that during the self-attention step, the model can only attend to earlier tokens in the sequence (and not future tokens). This ensures that GPT generates text from left to right, one token at a time, making it suitable for autoregressive tasks (predicting the next word).
	2.	Unidirectional Attention: In contrast to a bidirectional model like BERT (which attends to all words in a sentence simultaneously), GPT’s attention is unidirectional. The model only attends to the previous tokens, which means it generates one word at a time based on the context it has already seen.
	3.	Stacking Layers: GPT’s model stacks many layers of this unidirectional transformer architecture. Each layer allows the model to refine its understanding of the sequence and capture more complex patterns and dependencies.
	4.	Final Layer Output: After passing through all layers, the model produces a representation for each token in the sequence, and a softmax layer is used to predict the probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next token.

4. Training Process

During training, GPT is optimized to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous context. The training objective is to minimize the difference between the predicted token and the actual token using cross-entropy loss.
	•	Teacher Forcing: During training, the true output (the actual next token) is fed into the model for the next step, ensuring the model learns to predict the next word accurately.
	•	Autoregressive Generation: During inference (generation), the model generates one word at a time, feeding its own previous output back into the model to predict the next word.

5. Scaling Up

As models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 scaled up, they incorporated more layers, more attention heads, and vastly larger training datasets. GPT-3, for example, has 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest language models ever created. The larger the model, the more complex patterns it can learn, but it also requires massive computational resources to train and fine-tune.

Summary of Key Concepts:
	1.	Self-Attention: Allows each word to attend to all other words in a sequence, capturing relationships between distant words.
	2.	Multi-Head Attention: Enables the model to focus on multiple aspects of the input simultaneously.
	3.	Feed-Forward Neural Networks: Used after attention layers to process information further.
	4.	Residual Connections & Layer Normalization: Help stabilize training and improve model performance.
	5.	Positional Encoding: Adds information about the position of each word in the sequence.

This architecture is powerful because it allows the model to process entire sequences of data in parallel, instead of step-by-step, making it much more efficient for large-scale language tasks.

Key components of the transformer architecture and how you might implement them using PyTorch. We’ll focus on core parts of the architecture: Self-Attention, Multi-Head Attention, and the Transformer Block. This will give you a better idea of how a transformer like GPT is implemented at the code level.

1. Self-Attention Mechanism

First, let’s implement the Scaled Dot-Product Attention which is the core of self-attention.

import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

class ScaledDotProductAttention(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ScaledDotProductAttention, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, query, key, value, mask=None):
        # query, key, value: (batch_size, seq_len, embed_size)
        d_k = query.size(-1)  # Embed size
        scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)) / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(d_k, dtype=torch.float32))  # (batch_size, seq_len, seq_len)

        if mask is not None:
            scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)  # Apply mask to avoid attention to padding tokens

        attention_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)  # (batch_size, seq_len, seq_len)
        
        # Multiply attention weights with value
        output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, value)  # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_size)
        return output, attention_weights

2. Multi-Head Attention

The multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. Here’s how to implement it:

class MultiHeadAttention(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, num_heads):
        super(MultiHeadAttention, self).__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.embed_size = embed_size
        self.head_dim = embed_size // num_heads

        assert self.head_dim * num_heads == embed_size, "Embedding size must be divisible by num_heads"

        self.query_linear = torch.nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size)
        self.key_linear = torch.nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size)
        self.value_linear = torch.nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size)
        self.out_linear = torch.nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size)

        self.attention = ScaledDotProductAttention()

    def split_heads(self, x):
        # x shape: (batch_size, seq_len, embed_size)
        batch_size = x.size(0)
        # Split into num_heads
        x = x.view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.head_dim)
        return x.permute(0, 2, 1, 3)  # Shape: (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)

    def forward(self, query, key, value, mask=None):
        # Apply linear projections to Q, K, V
        query = self.query_linear(query)  # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_size)
        key = self.key_linear(key)  # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_size)
        value = self.value_linear(value)  # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_size)

        # Split into multiple heads
        query = self.split_heads(query)  # (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)
        key = self.split_heads(key)  # (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)
        value = self.split_heads(value)  # (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)

        # Attention computation
        output, attention_weights = self.attention(query, key, value, mask)

        # Concatenate heads and pass through output linear layer
        output = output.permute(0, 2, 1, 3).contiguous()  # (batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim)
        output = output.view(output.size(0), output.size(1), -1)  # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_size)

        return self.out_linear(output), attention_weights

3. Feed-Forward Neural Network

After attention, we typically have a position-wise feed-forward neural network to refine the output further.

class FeedForwardNetwork(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, ff_size, dropout=0.1):
        super(FeedForwardNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = torch.nn.Linear(embed_size, ff_size)
        self.fc2 = torch.nn.Linear(ff_size, embed_size)
        self.dropout = torch.nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.relu = torch.nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)  # (batch_size, seq_len, ff_size)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)  # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_size)
        return x

4. Transformer Block

Now that we have the multi-head attention and feed-forward network, we can combine them into a full transformer block. This will include residual connections and layer normalization for stability.

class TransformerBlock(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, num_heads, ff_size, dropout=0.1):
        super(TransformerBlock, self).__init__()
        self.multi_head_attention = MultiHeadAttention(embed_size, num_heads)
        self.feed_forward = FeedForwardNetwork(embed_size, ff_size, dropout)
        self.layer_norm1 = torch.nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)
        self.layer_norm2 = torch.nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)
        self.dropout = torch.nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        # Multi-head attention with residual connection
        attention_output, _ = self.multi_head_attention(x, x, x, mask)
        x = self.layer_norm1(x + self.dropout(attention_output))

        # Feed-forward network with residual connection
        ff_output = self.feed_forward(x)
        x = self.layer_norm2(x + self.dropout(ff_output))

        return x

5. Putting It All Together: A Simple Transformer Model

Now, let’s implement a simplified transformer model by stacking multiple transformer blocks.

class TransformerModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embed_size, num_heads, num_layers, ff_size, dropout=0.1):
        super(TransformerModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = torch.nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embed_size)
        self.positional_encoding = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, 5000, embed_size))  # Max sequence length 5000
        self.transformer_blocks = torch.nn.ModuleList([TransformerBlock(embed_size, num_heads, ff_size, dropout) for _ in range(num_layers)])
        self.fc_out = torch.nn.Linear(embed_size, vocab_size)
        self.dropout = torch.nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        x = self.embedding(x) + self.positional_encoding[:, :x.size(1), :]  # Add positional encoding

        for block in self.transformer_blocks:
            x = block(x, mask)

        x = self.fc_out(x)
        return x

6. Putting It All Together: Example Usage

Let’s assume we’re working with a dummy dataset and want to process it through the model. This is how you can run a forward pass:

# Model hyperparameters
vocab_size = 10000  # Example vocabulary size
embed_size = 512
num_heads = 8
num_layers = 6
ff_size = 2048
dropout = 0.1

# Create a model
model = TransformerModel(vocab_size, embed_size, num_heads, num_layers, ff_size, dropout)

# Example input (batch_size=2, sequence_length=10)
input_seq = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (2, 10))  # Random word indices
output = model(input_seq)  # Shape: (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size)

print(output.shape)  # Output shape should be (2, 10, vocab_size)

Key Concepts Covered:
	•	Self-Attention: This allows each word in a sequence to attend to other words in the sequence.
	•	Multi-Head Attention: Attention is split into multiple heads to focus on different parts of the input.
	•	Feed-Forward Network: A simple two-layer neural network applied after attention to further process the sequence.
	•	Transformer Block: A combination of multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, and normalization.
	•	Positional Encoding: Added to input embeddings to provide information about the order of words in the sequence.

Final Notes:

This is a simplified implementation, and in a production model (like GPT-3), you’d have many additional optimizations, like tokenization, efficient batching, gradient checkpointing, and much larger model sizes.
